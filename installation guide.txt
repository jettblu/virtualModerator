Doing this through an Anaconda virtual environment worked well for me
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install google-cloud-speech
pip install google-api-python-client==1.6.4
pip install PyAudio ( for this you will need Mircosoft c++ build tools which can be found here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)... or use conda install
