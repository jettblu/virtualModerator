# virtualModerator

Virtual moderator aims to provide real-time feedback on conversations by determining what participants say and how they say it. By providing real-time metrics such as volume, pace, and sentiment, speakers can optimize the acoustics of their speech while also controlling for content by cross-referencing related topics produced by the virtual moderator. Use of this library requires you to register a key with Google's speech to text API.
